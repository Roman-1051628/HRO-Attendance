We got the task to make a Attandence system for out school. 
There is a login and regestery system with selected roles.
The teachers are able to create students, append them to classes and create meetings.
Upon opening the the meeting a list of all the students and a qr-code are shown.
When the code is scanned the students are met with a login screen.
When logged in the students can check in.
Without refreshing the tist of students changes the checked in student to "Attending"
